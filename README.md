#provide-model

Not typically installed directly; helper module for [other
modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/provide-mssql).

Based on [this excellent example](https://www.promisejs.org/generators/) of the
immense combined power of promises and ES6 generators. And the fact that typing
extra code is lame.

##Testing

`npm test`
